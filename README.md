# music-screen

A small TKinter app that uses last.fm and shows currently playing content. It also uses discogs.com to fetch some extra data, mainly better images.

Inspired by https://github.com/hankhank10/music-screen-api: However this project is too tied to Sonos, this one is absolutley without that requirement. The whole point of this project is to give a solution to this problem absolutely without HW requirements. Also that other project is having multiple possible modes, and is very much tailored to one screen and size, so I ended up taking some code from there, but left a bunch of it alone and wrote mine.

# Getting started

You do not need much.
- Python3 and a small amount of dependencies
- Last.fm account (set it up in lastfm.py)
- Discogs account (set it up in discogs.py)
- A screen to run it on... I use a Raspberry Pi 4
